#Brooklyn-Nine-Nine-Walkthrough


                                                                                                                                         
   #Task 1

     1.  First connect the openvpn with the terminal 

         Then start the machine in the room to get the IP

         After the connection has build up and you have got the IP start _nmap_ scan on the IP with the command _nmap -sC -sV MACHINE_IP_


     2.  There are 3 ports open on the IP :- ftp ,ssh and http

       
         21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3

         ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)

         22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

         ssh-hostkey: 

           2048 16:7f:2f:fe:0f:ba:98:77:7d:6d:3e:b6:25:72:c6:a3 (RSA)

           256 2e:3b:61:59:4b:c4:29:b5:e8:58:39:6f:6f:e9:9b:ee (ECDSA)

           256 ab:16:2e:79:20:3c:9b:0a:01:9c:8c:44:26:01:58:04 (ED25519)
         
         80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu)

         With Service Info also : Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel


     3.  Now as the ftp port is open try to connect to it with command , _ftp  MACHINE_IP_ 

         For the name use _anonymous_ as given in nmap result in ftp section 

         And the password in this can be anything just press enter and you are in 


     4.  Start with command _ls_ and you get note_to_jake.txt file , cat command cannot be used here so use _get note_to_jake.txt_
       
         To download the file in your machine , After using _cat note_to_jake.txt_ the message from amy for jake appears which is "From Amy,

         Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine"
      
      
     5.  After that we have a hint that the Jake's password is weak so, now we try to brute force the password with the help of hydra 

         Use the command _hydra -l jake -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP_ to hydra to start it's work
        
         The password is 987654321 , With the password now do ssh login using command ssh jake@MACHINE_IP 

    6.  We got the access at jake@brookly-nine-nine so right now we are in /home/jake on listing the directories in jake we found nothing

        Now we will get back to home with _cd .._ where we will get 3 directories in which  directory named _holt_ shows us _user.txt_ file which has the key 

        The flag is ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee 


  #Task 2

    7.  Now we use _sudo -l_ to list user's privileges 

        User jake may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine: (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less

        For that matter we have to perform privilege escalation which could be then with the help of GTFOBins search less in GTFOBins to get how to access the root with the help of less

        So we got _sudo less/root/root.txt_ after which we get the flag which is 63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845
